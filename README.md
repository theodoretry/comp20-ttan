## COMP 20: Learning Portfolio ##

### What is this purpose of this Git repository?  ###

* To provide me a reference for the basics we have learned in this course. 

### What was your favorite lab or assignment and why? ###

* Probably the server-side or security assignments. They were something new that
  I had no experience with before and it was interesting to learn something
  that is so important to the whole web process, but which many people do not
  know about.

### How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now? ###

* I came in to this course having only a limited knowledge of the front-end, and
  I basically leared everything else here - from the back-end to the tools like 
  nodejs, mongoDB etc to security.

### What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence. ###

* The tools the trade that I can further use to explore web programming. 
  (Everything we learned in this class - nodejs, ajax, mongoDB, jQuery, etc)
* The structure of the web and what is really going on (How computers talk to 
  each other, how the structure of servers are set up)

### Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into? ###

* Security. Spending some time learning about security issues today has piqued
  my interest with regard to the details of these vulnerabilities and how they
  should be handled in the long run.
