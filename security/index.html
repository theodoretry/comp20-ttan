                <h1>Security and Privacy Assessment of Client-Side and Server-Side Code</h1>
                <h2>Prepared By: Theodore Tan</h2>
        </div>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>
        This Secuity Assesment documents the security and privacy vulnerabilities that exists in both
        the client-side and server-side web applications designed by Anthony Nguyen (COMP 20, Spring 
        2016). These web applications are Historic Landmarks and the server for Historic Landmarks
        respectively. According to specifications, the server application had to (1) maintain location 
        check-ins (login, lat, and long) for a long period of time, and (2) serves data on 
        the nearest U.S. historic landmarks within a mile of where you are (where the user checked in
        from). The client-side application would render a google map with the information returned by
        the server.
        </p>

        <h3>Methodology</h3>

        <p>
        Security testing was carried out in two stages: black-box and code review/white-box testing.
        The tools used for black-box testing were Mozilla Firefox's Tamper Data, Postman and curl.
        Using just these tools, mutiple vulnerabilities were detected. A review of the source code
        confirmed these loopholes.
        </p>

        <h3>Abstract of Findings</h3>

        <p>
        The application does have some safeguards against input that may cause it to crash (e.g. it 
        checks for appropriate latitude and longtitude values). However, the bulk of its security
        issues stem from the fact that it fails to check and validate user input before it is accepted. 
        As a result, malicious users will be able to manipulate the data sent to the application to
        acheive unwanted and dangerous results.
        </p>

        <h3>Issue #1 : Cross Site Scripting</h3>

        <ul>
        <li>Location of Vulnerability: GET API executes javascript posted to the server by a malicious source</li>
        <li>Severity of Vulnerability: HIGH. XSS is one of the biggest security loopholes in the present day.
            It may possibly compromise clients who expect the server to be secure, as malicious javascript can
            be exected in their browser upon GET request.</li>
